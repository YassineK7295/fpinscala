Chapter 1: Introduction to functional programming

1: What is functional programming?
Premise - We construct programs using only pure functions
	i.e. functions that have no side effects
A function has a side effect if it does something other than simply return a resule
	Modify variable, or data structure in place, or field on an object
	Throwing an exception or halting with an error
	Printing to the console or reading user input (I/O)
	Reading from or writing to a file, or drawing on the screen
FP is a restriction on how we write programs, not on what programs we can express
There is an increase in modularity that we grain from programming with pure functions
Pure functions (due to modularity), are then:
	Easier to test, reuse, parallelize, generaize, and reason aboue
	Thus much less prone to bugs

1.2: Exactly what is a (PURE) function?
A function f with input type A and output type B (written in Scala as a single type: A => B) is a computation that relates every value "a" of type A to exactly one value b of type B such that b is determined solely by the value of a
	Any changing state of an internal or external process is irrelevant to computing the result f(a)
	Ex. function intToString having type Int => String
No side effects: A function has no observable effect on the execution of the program other than to compute a result given its input
Function vs procedure:
	Function implies no side effects
	Procedure may have side effects
Referencial Transparency: the expression can be replaced by its result without changing the meaning of the program
	Ex. 2 + 3 in a program can be replaced by 5 and the program will do the same thing
*An expression e is referencially transparent if, for all programs p, all occurences of e in p can be replaced by the result of evaluating e without affecting the meaning of. A function f is pure if the expression f(x) is referentially transparent for all refenrentially transparent x.
1.3: Referential Transparency, Purity, And The Substitution Model
Prove StringBuilder.append is NOT a pure function
Pre RT substitution:
	val x = new StringBuilder("Hello")
	val y = x.append(", World!")
	val r1 = y.toString
	val r2 = y.toString
	-> r1 and r2 have the same value
Post RT substitution:
	val x = new StringBuilder("Hello")
	val r1 = x.append(", World!")
	val r2 = x.append(", World!")
	-> r1 and r2 do NOT have the same value
	-> thus append function is not a PURE function
	-> by the time r2 calls x.append, r1 will have already mutated the object reference by x

Chapter 2: Getting started with functional programming in Scala

"Unit" return type serves the same purpose as "void"
Scala code has to be in an object or a class
Methods take the form of:
	def methodName(paramName: ParamType): ReturnType = { ...code here ... }
Terminating semicolon is optional
Curly braces for method body is optional IF the method implementation is only one expression

The "object" keyword creates a new singleton type, which is like a "class" that only has a single named instance
Scala has no equivalent to Java's "static" keyword
	An "object" is often used in Scala where you might use a class with static members in Java (Ex. for the main method)
The "return" keyword is optional, where usually the last computer expression is returned
The return type itself is option, as Scala can infer the type
	Unless it's a private function, it's generally best practice to include the return type
Statements are separated by newlines or by semicolons
A "val" in an immutable variable
The "main" method is sometimes called a procedure to emphasize the fact that it has side effects
	def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = { ... }
Scala will look for a method named "main" with a specific signature when the program runs
Usually a return type of "Unit" is a hint that the method has a side effect

2.2: Running Our Program
The build tool for Scala is "sbt"
To invoke the Scala compiler and copile the Scala code to Java bytcode, use the "scalac" compiler
> scalac MyModule.scala
This will generate files ending with the ".class" suffix
	These files contain compiled code that can be run with the JVM
The code can be executed using the "scala" command-line tool:
> scala MyModule
You can also load a file into REPL
> scala // to open Scala REPL
scala> :load MyModule.scala
You can past code that spans multiple lines with the command ":paste"

2.3: Modules, Objects, and Namespaces
Every value in Scala is an "object" and each "object" may have zero or more "members"
	Unlike Java, values of primative types like Int are also considered objects
An object whose primary purpose is giving its members a namespace is sometimes called a "module"
A "member" can be a method declared with the "def" keyword, or it can be another object declaed with "val" or "object"
Typical object-oriented dot notation follows:
	A namespace followed by a dot, followed by the name of the member
	MyModule.abs(-42)
Function takes params vs method which is a member of an object
	method(obj, 12) vs obj.method(12)
Like the "+" method, any method can be called without the dot and parantheses when there is a single argument
	1 + 3 == 1.+(3)
	MyModule.abs(42) == MyModule abs 42
By importing an object, you bring it's members into scope
scala> import MyModule.abs
scala> abs(-24)
You can bring all of an object's (nonprivate) members into scope with underscore syntax
scala> import MyModule._

2.4: Higher-Order Functions: Passing Functions to Functions
Functions as values, functions can:
	be assigned to variables, stored in data structures, and passed as arguments to functions
HOFs allow functions as parameters
To avoid mutating a loop variable, loops are written as recursive functions
Scala detects this sort of self-recursion and compiles it to the same sort of bytecode as would be emitted for a while loop
	This avoids StackOverflowError as each function call will consume a call stack fram for each iterations
def factorial(n: Int) = {
	def go(m: Int, res: Int) =
		if (m <= 1) res
		else go(m-1, m*res)
	
	go(n, 1)
}
A call is said to be in "tail position" if the called does nothing other than return the value of the recursive call
	go(m-1, m*res) is in tail position
	1 + go(m-1, m*res) is not
Scala compiles these into iterative loops
We can tell Scala compiler using the "tailrec" annotation so it can give us a compile error if it's unable to eliminate the tail calls of the function
	@annotation.tailrec
	def go(m: Int, res: Int): Int = ...
Passing a function as a param
	def formatResult(name: String, n: Int, f: Int => Int): String = {
		val msg = "The %s of %d is %d"
		msg.format(name, n, f(n))
	}
Variable-naming conventions
	It's common convention to use names like f, g, and h for parameters to a higher-order function
	HOF are so general that they have no opinion on what the argument should actually do

2.5: Polymorphic Functions: Abstracting Over Types
Monomorphic functions - functions that operate on only one type of data
Polymorphic functions - functions that operate on more than one type of data
	Parametric polymorphism, not to be confuse with OOP concept of polymorphism
Ex. Here we pass the comparison for each type as the to some value
	def findFirst[A](arr: Array[A], p: A => Boolean): Int = {
		@annotation.tailrec
		def loop(n: Int): Int =
			if (n >= arr.length) -1
			else if (p(arr(n))) n
			else loop(n + 1)
		
		loop(0)
	}
"A" here is a "type variable" (convention is one upper cased letter), and is part of a list called the "type parameters"
Annonymous functions are sometimes passed to HOF
	(x: Int, y: Int) => x == y
	Scala inferes the return type, so it's missing here
Functions as values in Scala
	A function lieral is action an object with a method called apply
	Object that have the "apply" method, can be called as if they themselves were methods
	Function literal like (a, b) => a < b, is really for object creation:
		val lessThan = new Function2[Int, Int, Boolean] {
			def apply(a: Int, b: Int) = a < b
		}
	Calling the lessThan method is the same as calling the lessThan.apply
	Function2 is a train (an interface) to represent function objects that take two arguments
Functions are called "first-class values" because they are just ordinary Scala objects

2.6: Following Types To Implementations
Scala's standard library provides a "compose" method on "Function1" interface
	f "compose" g
	g "andThen" f
	f(g(x))
	scala> val f = (x: Double) => math.Pi / 2 - x
	scala> val cos = f andThen math.sin

Chapter 3: Functional data structures

3.1: Defining Functional Data Structures
Functional data structures are by definition immutable
In general, we introduce a data type with the "trait" keyword"
A "trait" is an abstract interfact that may optionally contain implementations of some methods
Adding "sealed" in front means that all implementations of the "trait" must be declared in this file
A List can be empty, denoted by the data constructor Nil, or it can be nonempty, denoted by the data constructor Cons
A nonempty list consists of an initial element, "head", followed by a List (possibly empty) of the remaining elements (the tail)
	sealed trait List[+A]
	case object Nil extends List[Nothing]
	case class Cons[+A](head: A, tail: List[A]) extends List[A]
Example: List("a", "b") is the same as Cons("a", Cons("b", Nil))
	Similar to a Singly Linked List
The "+" in front of the type parameter A is a "variance annotation" that signals that A is a "covariant" or "positive" parameter of List
	If A is Int, because of the "+", we also cover all subtypes of Int (such as Nil)
	Formally put: for all types X and Y, if X is a subtype of Y, then List[X] is a subtype of List[Y]
	"Nothing" is a subtype of all types, which means that in conjunction with the variance annotation, Nil can be considered a List[Int], a List[Double], etc.

3.2: Pattern Matching
def product(ds: List[Double]): Double = ds match {
	case Nil: 0
	case Cons(0.0, _) => 0.0
	case Cons(x, xs) => x * product(xs)
}
*It's common convention to use xs, ys, as, or bs as variable names for a sequence of some sort, and x, y, a, or b as the name of a single element of a sequence
If multiple patterns match the target, Scala chooses the first matching case
Companion objects
	A "companion object" is just an object with the same name as the data type
	It's where the functions for creating or working with values of the data type live
The pattern "_" matches any expression
	List(1, 2, 3) match { case _ => 42 } results in 42
	Inicates a variable whose value does not affect the result of the case
Capture or bind a subexpression
	List(1, 2, 3) match { case Cons(h, _) => h } results in 1
		Uses a data constructor pattern to capture the first element in this case
	List(1, 2, 3) match { case Cons(_, t) => t } results in List(2, 3)
	List(1, 2, 3) match { case Nil => 42 } results in MatchError at runtime
		MatchError => none of the cases match
Variadic Functions
	Functions where a parameter represents zero or more of that type
	def apply[A](as: A*): List[A] = ...
	Syntactic sugar for creating and passing a "Seq" of elements
	"Seq" is the interface in Scala, implemented by sequence-like data structures such as lists, queues, or vectors
	The argument "as" will be bound to a Seq[A], which has functions "head" and "tail"
	The special "_*" type annotation allows us to pass a Seq to a variadic method

3.3: Data Sharing in Functional Data Structures
When we add an element to the front of an existing list, we return a new list, (ex. Cons(1, xs)
Since lists are immutable, we don't need to copy xs, we can just reuse it
	This is called "data sharing"
When removing an element from the front, we simply take the tail of the constructor
	The original list is still available
Linked list:
	["a", ref] -> ["b", ref] -> ["c", ref] -> ["d", ref]
	List("a", "b", "c", "d") has ref of element "a"
	List("a", "b", "c", "d").tail has ref of element "b"
	List("b", "c", "d") has ref of element "b"
	All lists use the same data in memory

3.3.2: Improving type inference for higher-order functions
To improve type inference, you can break an argument list into sub lists
When a function has multiple argument groups, type information flows from left to right across these argument groups, not requiring type annotation
def dropWhile[A](as: List[A])(f: A => Boolean): List[A] = ...
val ex1 = dropWhile(List(1,2,3,4))(x => x < 4)
* dropWhile is curried
	A function of two arguments can be represented as a function that accepts one argument and returns another function of one argument

3.4: Recursion Over Lists and Generalizing to Higher-Order Functions
If we remove the short-circuit case of the product method (i.e. case Cons(0.0, _) => 0.0) then the sum and product methods are mostly identical
	The differences remain the type of list the list, the return value of the Nil, and the operation
Here, we can extract the commonalities, and implement sum and product using the generalized function (i.e. foldRight)
def foldRight[A,B](as: List[A], z: B)(f: (A, B) => B): B = as match {
	case Nil => z
	case (x, xs) => f(x, foldRight(xs, z)(f))
}
def sum(as: List[Int]): Int = {
	foldRight(as, 0)((x, y) => x + y)
}
def product(as: List[Double]): Double = {
	foldRight(as, 1.0)(_ * _) // shorthand for (x, y) => x * y
}

Underscore notation can be used for parameters of an annonymous function
	(x + y) => x + y is equivalent to _ + _, so long as Scala can infer the types

"List" in the Scala standard library uses "::" for "Cons"
	Cons(1, Cons(2, Nil)) is actually 1 :: (2 :: Nil), both equal to List(1, 2)
	For pattern matching, Cons(x, xs) becomes x :: xs
*In Scala, all methods whose names end in ":" are right-associative
	The expression "x :: xs" is actually "xs.::(x)", which in turn calls the data constructor ::(x, xs)

Some useful methods for lists, defined as methods ON List[A], rather than standalone functions
	def take(n: Int): List[A] - Returns a list consisting of the first "n" elements of "this"
	def takeWhile(f: A => Boolean): List[A] - Longest valid prefix of "this" whose elements all pass the predicate f
	def forall(f: A => Boolean): Boolean - "true" if and only if all elements pass the predicate f
	def exists(f: A => Boolean): Boolean - "true" if any element passes the predicate f
	scanLeft and scanRight - Like foldLeft and foldRight, but they return the List of partial results rather than just the final accumulated value

3.4.2: Loss of efficiency when assembling list functions from simpler components
A problem with List is that, although the operations and algorithms are general-purpose funcions, the resulting implementation isn't always efficient
	We may end up making multiple passes over the same input

3.5: Trees
Algebraic data type (ADT) is a data type defined by one or more data constructors, each of which may contain zero or more arguments
	The data type is the "sum" or "union" of its data constructors
	Each data constructor is the "product" of its arguments
	Lists are an example of an ADT
Pairs and tuples of other arities (arities - The number of arguments or operands a function or operation takes) are also ADTs
> val p = ("Bob", 42)
> p._1
> p match { case (a, b) => b }
p is a pair whose type is (String, Int), which is syntactic sugar for Tuple2[String, Int]
	We can pattern match like any other case class

Simple binary tree
	sealed trait Tree[+A]
	case class Leaf[A](value: A) extends Tree[A]
	case class Branch[A](left: Tree[A], right: Tree[A]) extends Tree[A]
Leaf is a tree with no childrean trees, only a value
Branch is a tree with only children trees, no value (for this implementation)

We typically use ADTs for situations where the set of cases is "closed" (known to be fixed)
	For List and Tree, changing the set of data constructors would significantly change what these data types are
	List is a singly linked list with two cases: Nil and Cons

Chapter 4: Handling errors without exceptions

We can represent failures and exceptions with ordinary values & we can write HOFs that abstract out common patterns of error handling and recovery
	Returning errors as values is safer and retains referential transparency

4.1. THE GOOD AND BAD ASPECTS OF EXCEPTIONS
Referential transparent (RT) expressions do not depend on context and may be reasoned about locally
	Non-RT expressions are context-dependent and require more global reasoning
	RT expression 42 + 5 does not depend on anything else, it's always 47
	"throw new Exception("fail")" depends on which try block (if any) it's nested within

Two main problems with exceptions:
	1) Exceptions break RT and introduce context dependence
		Exceptions should be used only for error handling, not for control flow
	2) Exceptions are not type-safe
		The signature does not tell anything about the fact that exceptions may occur
		If you forget to check for an exception, the exception wont be detected until runtime

Checked exceptions
- Java's checked exceptions force a decision about how to handle or reraise an error, but result in builerplate for callers
	This solution wont work for HOFs bc HOFs are unaware of what exceptions their arguments could raise
	"map" does not know what exception the function argument can throw

- Primary benefit of exceptions: allow us to consolidate and centralize error-handling logic

4.2: POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES TO EXCEPTIONS
"Seq" is the common interface of various linear sequence-like collections
A "partial function" is a function not defined for some inputs (i.e. throws exception for some inputs)
	Function makes some assumptions about its inputs that aren't implied by the input types
	Non-terminating for some inputs is another reason
Returning a default value or null has a few consequences
	Allows the error to silently propogate
		Compiler wont inform the caller if they forget to check this condition
	Explicit "if" statements to check whether the caller has received a "real" result (per caller)
	Not applicable to polymorphic code
		Some output types might not have a sentinel value of that type
			Null can only be returned for non-primatives, wont work for Boolean output type
	Passing function as HOF become difficult
		Each function must be treated differently to account for its "real value check"

4.3. THE OPTION DATA TYPE
"Option" has two cases
	It can be defined -> also known as "Some"
	Or it can be undefinted -> also known as "None"
> sealed trait Option[+A]
> case class Some[+A](get: A) extends Option[A]
> case class None extends Option[Nothing]
>
> def mean(xs: Seq[Double]): Option[Double] =
>	if (xs.isEmpty) None
>	else Some(xs.sum / xs.length)
The return type now reflects the possibility that the result may not always be defined
"mean" is a "total function" because we always return Option[Double]
	Every valid output is wrapped in "Some"
	Every invalid input is mapped to "None"
	The compiler forces the caller to deal explicitly with the possibility of failure

4.3.1: Usage patterns for Option
- Map lookup for given key returns Option
- headOption and lastOption defined for lists and other iterables return an Option containing the first or last elements of a sequence if it's nonemtpy
- Option can be thought of like a List that can contain at most one element
	- Many List functions have analogous functions on Option
- Analogous functions:
	- def map[B](f: A => B): Option[B]
		- apply f if the Option is not None
	- def flatMapt[B](f: A => Option[B]): Option[B]
		- apply f, which may fail, to the Option if not None
	- def getOrElse[B >: A](default: => B): B
		- The B >: A says that te B type parameter must be a supertype of A
	- def orElse[B >: A](ob: => Option[B]): Option[B]
		- Don't evaluate ob unless needed
	- def filter(f: A => Boolean): Option[B]
		- convert Some to None if the value doesn't satisfy f
- "default: => B" type annotation indicates that the argument is of type B, but won't be evaluated until it's needed by the function

*** Case class has a constructor with arguments, and therefore can exist as many instances
*** Case object does not take arguments for it's constructor, and so exists as a singleton

- You can apply many functions to an Option, even if it has a null value, without having to handle null checks upfront
	- Null checks are deferred for later code to handle
	> lookupByName("Joe").map(_.department).getOrElse("Default Dept.")
		- does not error out if the lookup returns null

- flapMap is similar to map, except the function that we provide to transform the result can itself fail
	- we can construct a computation with multiple stages, any of which may fail, and the computation will abort as soon as the first failure is encountered, since None.flatMap(f) will immediately return None, without running f.
