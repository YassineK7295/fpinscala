# Exercises From "Functional Programming in Scala"

* Exercise 2.1: Fibonacci sequence using recursion
* Exercise 2.2: Implement isSorted, which checks whether an Array[A] is sorted according to a given comparison function
* Exercise 2.3: Curry HOF
* Exercise 2.4: Uncurry HOF (INCOMPLETE)
* Exercise 2.5: Composition of a function

* Exercise 3.1: What will be the result of the following match expression?
* Exercise 3.2: Implement the function tail for removing the first element of a List.
* Exercise 3.3: Implement the function setHead for
                replacing the first element of a List with a different value.
* Exercise 3.4: Generalize tail to the function drop, which removes the first n elements from a list.
* Exercise 3.5: Implement dropWhile, which removes elements from the List prefix as long as they match a predicate.
